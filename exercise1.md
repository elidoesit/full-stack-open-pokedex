For a small Golang development team of 6 with limited resources and a focus on velocity, optimizing the CI/CD setup is crucial. Leveraging native Golang tools like golint for linting and go test for testing ensures simplicity and efficiency while keeping costs low. Cloud-based CI/CD platforms such as Travis CI or CircleCI offer ideal solutions, requiring no upfront investment, providing free tiers suitable for small teams, and minimizing maintenance overhead. Given the need for speed and cost-effectiveness, opting for a cloud-based environment proves advantageous, allowing the team to focus on development tasks without the burden of managing infrastructure. By prioritizing lightweight tools and cloud-based CI/CD platforms, the team can achieve rapid development cycles, maintain high velocity, and deliver quality code within budget constraints.
